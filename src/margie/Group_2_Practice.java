public class Group_2_Practice {

    //Hello Group 2
    //How are you?
}
//### Team Lead Action:
//1. Create a new project with your group name included for example `group_x_project`
//2. Add `.gitignore` with below content
//
//.idea
//out
//*.iml
//
//3. Create a package `us100` and class under `Practice`
//4. Commit your changes
//5. Share project on GitHub
//6. Share your URL With your team member
//7. Invite your team members using their github username (NOT EMAIL!!)
//8. In your Github.com repo ,
//   1. Go to `Setting`->`Manage Access`-> `Invite Collaborator`
//   2. Enter your teammate username and click invite


//### Group members action
//1. Navigate to the URL your team lead shared , observe you have write access
//2. Copy the clone link under `Code` Button
//3. Clone this project to your IntelliJ
//


//### Everybody (DO NOT COMMIT ANYTHING TO MASTER)
//1. In a well collaborated work environment , nobody should commit to master directly without going through `GitHub Flow`
//2. Assuming you are all working on your own test case , open a branch with test case followed by your name
//   1. for example : `tc006_akbar`
//3. Create a package with your name for example in my case `akbar` (do this so we can avoid conflicts for now)
//   1. Create your java class under, for example `LoginTestCase` you can call it anything
//4. make few commits
//5. push your local feature branch commits to remote (always pull before pushing)
//6. Open a pull request with proper name and description and click create
//7. ask your team member to review or comment and merge your pull request
//   1. IDEALLY NOBODY SHOULD BE MERGING THEIR OWN PULL REQUEST EVEN THOUGH THERE IS NO RESTRICTION RIGHT NOW
//8. Now from your IntelliJ , checkout master and update project to pull down all the changes from remote
//9. Observe your Git history and be amazed!
